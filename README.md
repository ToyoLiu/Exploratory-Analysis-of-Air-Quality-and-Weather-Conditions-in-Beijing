### Exploratory Analysis of Air Quality and Weather Conditions in Beijing

**Brief Description:** 

Conducted an exploratory analysis of air quality and weather data in Beijing to understand key environmental factors and prepare for future predictive modeling.

**Time Period:**  
Sept 2023 - Oct 2023

**Tools:**  
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Key Achievements:**
- Analyzed a dataset containing 2,376 records with 12 attributes, including AQI, PM2.5, PM10, and weather conditions, to evaluate air quality trends and correlations between variables.
- Developed visualizations such as heatmaps and distribution plots to examine correlations among air quality indicators and identify potential outliers.
- Implemented data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing data and outlier detection, to ensure data quality for subsequent modeling.
- Generated insights into the relationship between air quality and meteorological factors, laying the groundwork for developing predictive models using time series analysis and machine learning algorithms.
